  - TN is a nonimmigrant visa (requires nonimmigrant intent)
  - Filing I-140 or I-485 can be seen as immigrant intent
  - **Risk:** CBP may deny entry if they believe you have immigrant intent
  - **Safer approach:** File I-140 (doesn't require travel), then file I-485 when ready to adjust status
  - Once I-485 is pending, maintain valid TN status until green card approved
  - **Best practice:** Consult immigration attorney before filing I-140/I-485 on TN status

## 10. Per-Country Cap

### Per-Country Limit Percentage
- **Per-country limit:** **7%** of total annual family-sponsored and employment-based preference limits
- **Calculation:** 
  - Family-sponsored limit: 226,000 (FY 2026)
  - Employment-based limit: 140,000 (minimum, can be higher)
  - **Total:** 366,000
  - **7% of 366,000 = 25,620** visas per country per year

### Annual EB Visa Allocation
- **Total employment-based visas:** **140,000** per year (minimum)
- **Per-country limit:** **7% = ~9,800** per country (if 140,000 total)
- **Actual per-country limit:** **25,620** (calculated from combined family + employment limits)
- **Spillover:** Unused visas from one category/country can be used by others
- **Dependent area limit:** **2% = 7,320**

### How Per-Country Cap Affects Backlogs
- **India and China:** Heavily oversubscribed due to high demand
- **Backlog calculation:** More applicants than visas available = priority date backlog
